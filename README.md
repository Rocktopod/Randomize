Randomize
=========
These are simple scripts I wrote.  One will add a pseudorandom 4-digit number to the beginning of the selected file 
names, and the other will remove the first 4 characters from the selected file names.  They are designed to allow 
files to be given a random order for media players that do not support a shuffle function.

Created by Rocktopod.


INSTRUCTIONS:

To randomize, make sure all the files you want to randomize are in the same directory as the .sh files, and then run
randomize.sh (in linux this means opening the terminal in that directory and entering './randomize.sh'). You will 
be prompted to enter the file extension of the files you wish to rename.

To delete the random numbers, simply run the deRandomize.sh script.  WARNING! THIS WILL DELETE THE FIRST 4 CHARACTERS
FROM THE FILE NAMES REGARDLESS OF IF THEY ARE "RANDOM."  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
